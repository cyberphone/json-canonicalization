      <t>
        Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing depend on that the
        target data does not change during serialization, transport, or parsing.
        By applying the rules defined by JCS (JSON Canonicalization Scheme),
        data provided in the JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> format can be exchanged "as is",
        while still being subject to secure cryptographic operations.
        JCS achieves this by building on the serialization formats for JSON primitives
        as defined by ECMAScript <xref target="ES6"/>, constraining JSON data
        to the I&nbhy;JSON <xref target="RFC7493"/> subset,
        and through a platform independent property sorting scheme.

      <t>
        Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing depend on that the
        target data does not change during serialization, transport, or parsing.
        A straightforward way of accomplishing this is converting the data into
        a format having a simple and fixed representation like Base64Url <xref target="RFC4648"/>,
        used in JWS <xref target="RFC7515"/>.
        Another solution is creating a canonicalized version of the target data
        with XML Signature <xref target="XMLDSIG"/> as a prime example.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the objective was keeping the data "as is", the canonicalization
        method was selected.  For avoiding "reinventing the wheel",
        JCS relies on serialization of JSON primitives compatible with
        ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) beginning with version 6 <xref target="ES6"/>,
        from now on simply referred to as "ES6".
      </t>
      <t>
        Seasoned XML developers recalling difficulties getting signatures
        to validate (usually due to different interpretations of the quite intricate
        XML canonicalization rules as well as of the equally extensive
        Web Services security standards), may rightfully wonder why JCS
        would not suffer from similar issues. The reasons are twofold:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The absence of a namespace concept and default values, as well
            as constraining data to I&nbhy;JSON eliminate the need for specific
            parsing schemes for canonicalized data.
          </t>
          <t>
            JCS compatible serialization of JSON primitives is already supported by most
            Web browsers and Node.js <xref target="NODEJS"/>,
            while the full JCS specification is supported by multiple
            Open Source implementations (see <xref target="open.source"/>),
            giving the proposed canonicalization scheme a head start.
            Also see <xref target="impl.guidelines"/>.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The JCS specification describes how serialization of JSON primitives compliant
        with ES6, combined with an elementary property sorting scheme, can be used for
        supporting &quot;Crypto&nbsp;Safe&quot; JSON.
      </t>
      <t>
        JCS is compatible with some existing systems relying on JSON canonicalization
        such as JWK Thumbprint <xref target="RFC7638"/> and Keybase <xref target="KEYBASE"/>.

        <t>
          In order to canonicalize JSON data, an internal representation

            the result would (with a line wrap added for display purposes only),

            The reason for the difference between the parsed data and its

            by JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/>), while output data (as defined by ES6),
            has a fixed representation.  As can be seen by the example,
            numbers are subject to rounding as well.

              such functionality MUST be delegated to the application layer

              <t>
                JSON <spanx style="verb">Object</spanx> properties MUST be sorted in a recursive manner

                type MUST be subject to sorting as well.

              <t>
                JSON <spanx style="verb">Array</spanx> data MUST also be scanned for
                presence of sortable JSON <spanx style="verb">Object</spanx> elements,
                but array element order MUST NOT be changed.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            When a JSON <spanx style="verb">Object</spanx> is about to have its properties
            sorted, the following measures MUST be adhered to:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                The sorting process is applied to property strings in their &quot;raw&quot; (unescaped) form.
                That is, a newline character is treated as U+000A.
              </t>
              <t>
                Property strings to be sorted are formatted
                as arrays of UTF-16 <xref target="UNICODE"/> code units.
                The sorting is based on pure value comparisons, where code units are treated as
                unsigned integers, independent of locale settings.
              </t>
              <t>
                Property strings either have different values at some index that is
                a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both.
                If they have different values at one or more index
                positions, let k be the smallest such index; then the string whose
                value at position k has the smaller value, as determined by using
                the &lt; operator, lexicographically precedes the other string.
                If there is no index position at which they differ,
                then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string.
                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                In plain english this means that property names are sorted in ascending order like the following:
              </t>
            </list>

            </figure>
          </t>
          <t>
            The rationale for basing the sort algorithm on UTF-16 code units is that
            it maps directly to the string type in ECMAScript, Java and .NET.
            Systems using another internal representation of string data will need to convert
            JSON property strings into arrays of UTF-16 code units before sorting.
            The conversion from UTF-8 or UTF-32 to UTF-16 is defined by the
            Unicode <xref target="UNICODE"/> standard.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Note: for the purpose obtaining a deterministic property order, sorting on
            UTF-8 or UTF-32 encoded data would also work, but the result would differ
            (and thus be incompatible with this specification).

        Note: for maximum compliance with ECMAScript's JSON object, values that are
        to be interpreted as true integers,
        SHOULD be in the range -9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991.

        Note: although a set of specific integers like 2**68 (4430000000000000 in IEEE-754 format)
        could be regarded as having extended precision, the JCS/ES6 number serialization
        algorithm does not take this in consideration.

    <section anchor="json.wireformat" title="Canonicalized JSON as &quot;Wire Format&quot;">
      <t>
        Since the result from the canonicalization process (see <xref target="json.utf8"/>),
        is fully valid JSON, it can also be used as "Wire&nbsp;Format".
        However, this is just an option since cryptographic schemes
        based on JCS, in most cases would not depend on that externally
        supplied JSON data already is canonicalized.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        In fact, the ES6 standard way of serializing objects using
        <spanx style="verb">JSON.stringify()</spanx> produces a
        more "logical" format, where properties are
        kept in the order they were created or received.  The
        example below shows an address record which could benefit from
        ES6 standard serialization:
      </t>
      <t>
        <figure align="center"><artwork><![CDATA[  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "address": "2000 Sunset Boulevard",
    "city": "Los Angeles",
    "zip": "90001",
    "state": "CA"
  }]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>
        Using canonicalization the properties above would be output in the order
        "address", "city", "name", "state" and "zip", which adds fuzziness
        to the data from a human (developer or technical support), perspective.
      </t>
      <t>
        That is, for many applications, canonicalization would only be used internally
        for creating a "hashable" representation of the data needed for cryptographic
        operations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note: if message size is not a concern, you may even send "Pretty&nbsp;Printed"
        JSON data on the wire (since whitespace always is ignored by the canonicalization process).

      <t>
        There are two major issues associated with the
        JSON <spanx style="verb">Number</spanx> type, here illustrated by the following
        sample object:
      </t>
      <t>
        <figure align="center"><artwork><![CDATA[  {
    "giantNumber": 1.4e+9999,
    "payMeThis": 26000.33,
    "int64Max": 9223372036854775807
  }]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>
        Although the sample above conforms to JSON (according to <xref target="RFC8259"/>),
        there are some practical hurdles to consider:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Standard JSON parsers rarely process "giantNumber" in a meaningful way.
            64-bit integers like "int64Max" normally pass through parsers, but in
            systems like ES6, at the expense of lost precision.
          </t>
          <t>
            Another issue is that parsers typically would use different schemes for handling
            "giantNumber" and "int64Max".  In addition, monetary data like "payMeThis" would
            presumably not rely on a floating point system due to rounding issues with respect
            to decimal arithmetic.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            The (to the author NB), only known way handling this kind of "overloading" of the
            <spanx style="verb">Number</spanx> type (at least in an extensible manner), is through 
            mapping mechanisms, instructing parsers what to do with different properties
            based on their name.  However, this greatly limits the value of using the
            <spanx style="verb">Number</spanx> type outside of its original
            somewhat constrained, JavaScript context.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        For usage with JCS (and in fact for any usage of JSON by multiple
        parties potentially using independently developed software), numbers that do
        not have a natural place in the current JSON ecosystem MUST be wrapped
        using the JSON <spanx style="verb">String</spanx> type.  This is close to
        a de-facto standard for open systems.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Aided by a mapping system; be it programmatic like

      <t>
        or declarative schemes like OpenAPI <xref target="OPENAPI"/>,
        there are no real limits, not even when using ES6.

    </section>

    <section anchor="impl.guidelines" title="Implementation Guidelines">
      <t>
        The optimal solution is integrating support for JCS directly
        in JSON serializers (parsers need no changes).
        That is, canonicalization would just be an additional &quot;mode&quot;
        for a JSON serializer. However, this is currently not the case.
        Fortunately JCS support can be performed through externally supplied
        canonicalizer software, enabling signature creation schemes like the following:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Create the data to be signed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Serialize the data using existing JSON tools.
          </t>
          <t>
            Let the external canonicalizer process the serialized data and return canonicalized result data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Sign the canonicalized data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Add the resulting signature value to the original JSON data through a designated signature property.
          </t>
          <t>
            Serialize the completed (now signed) JSON object using existing JSON tools.
          </t>
        </list>
        A compatible signature verification scheme would then be as follows:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Parse the signed JSON data using existing JSON tools.

            Remove the signature property from the parsed JSON object.

            Let the external canonicalizer process the serialized data and return canonicalized result data.

            Verify that the canonicalized data matches the saved signature value
            using the algorithm and key used for creating the signature.

        A canonicalizer like above is effectively only a &quot;filter&quot;, potentially usable with
        a multitude of quite different cryptographic schemes.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Using a JSON serializer with integrated JCS support, the serialization performed
        before the canonicalization step could be eliminated for both processes.
